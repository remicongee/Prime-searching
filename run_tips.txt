In order that *.o files are well compiled, type command:
  $ make all
in your terminal.
If you want to clean these *.o files, type
  $ make clean

Once compilation is well done, type in terminal :
  $ ./run.sh PATH
where "PATH" is the path of hosts file containing nodes.
This parameter is exactly what we use in command:
  $ mpirun -np N -f PATH CODE

NOTE: Please execute run.sh in the folder of source code.

When run.sh is run, it will give instructions for further
settings such as number of process, range of primes, etc.

Here is an example:

input:
	parallels@node1:/media/psf/project/Project2Code$ make all
output:	mpicc prime.c -lm -o prime.o	mpicc primeUp.c -lm -o primeUp.o	mpicc naive.c -lm -o naive.o	Compile completed.	chmod a+x ./run.sh

input: (./run.sh PATH)	parallels@node1:/media/psf/project/Project2Code$ ./run.sh /home/parallels/	
	mpich-install/hostfile1

output instructions:	Please choose version of searching primes program:	0--prime broadcast(naive) 1--replicate preprocess, 2--eliminate even numbers.	0	Please enter an integer larger than 1 for range of primes: 	100	Primes will be displayed?	0--count, 1--display	1	Please set process number:	3	Multiple nodes required.outputï¼š
	Primes will be dispalyed.	Start searching primes less than or equal to 100.	2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 71 73 79 83 89 97 	25 primes are less than or equal to 100	Total elapsed time:   0.008039
